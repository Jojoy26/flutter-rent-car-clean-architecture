## Description

This is my first app with flutter using clean architecture, in this app I chose to use firebase as a backend because it is simpler than creating my own backend, aiming that my object was to try to apply the clean architecture.

The focus I had was to try to apply the clean architecture as detached as possible, of course it still contains some flaws of mine, but as a first project I found it acceptable, but my biggest difficulty was in the unit tests I feel I couldn't apply what came well studying, I also felt that I was not going as I wanted so I stopped taking the tests in the middle of the project, I think I still have to study more about tests.
Even so, I think I did well for a first project and I will try to improve more from now on.
